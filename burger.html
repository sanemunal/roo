      <h1 class="w3-center">Johanne Kathleen Rowling</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">The World's First Billionaire Author</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Johanne Kathleen Rowling was born in Yate, Gloucestershire, England in 31 July, 1965. Her writing is under the pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith. She is a British novelist, screenwriter, and producer who is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series. The books have won multiple awards, and sold more than 400 million copies, becoming the best-selling book series in history. They have also been the basis for a film series, over which Rowling had approval on the scripts and was a producer on the final films in the series.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a train from Manchester to London in 1990. Before she published her first novel in the series, in seven years period, she had seen the death of her mother, had given birth of her first child, had divorced from her first husband and had suffered from poverty. The first novel in series, Harry Potter and Sorcerer’s Stone, was published in 1997 and the last one, Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. After that, Rowling has written books for adult readers.</p>

     <p class="w3-large">Although she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother.</p>
     <p class="w3-large">Her books had been read by millions of people and she became the world’s first billionaire author. However, she lost her billionaire status from giving away much of her earnings to charity. Even though she is no longer a billionaire, she is the United Kingdom's best-selling living author. The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £600 million. In October 2010, Rowling was named the "Most Influential Woman in Britain" by leading magazine editors. She has supported lots of charities.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Harry Potter for Me</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">When ı read Harry Potter at the first time, ı was nine years old. I remember that ı found it really entertaining. To be honest, I had no close friend so ı was influenced by friendship between triple. Magic was fascinating and during the story, ı soared after it in my mind. Later ı understood that it tells more than a wizard’s life. Harry Potter achived to get rid of difficult conditions even though he was a kid. When nobody belived him, he tried to do what was true according to his belief. He had to brake rules. When all forces was againist him, he managed to take a stand in favour of goodness. He wasn’t perfect, he made mistakes but he did everything to fix them. When ı read his story, ı belived that even a boy could be able to change the world.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Over seven novels, we read Harry Potter’s advantures during the time in Hogwarts. We could feel the friendship between Harry, Hermione and Ron, bravery for love, the war between good and bad, stand againist evil and the price of trying to change the world into a fair place. Rowling’s imagine-power created a new world: Wizarding World. It is too different from mine. People have access what they want to reach. They have power of magic. They have their own rules. But at the same time, it is too similar with my world because people feel, think and behave in the same way. Love, hate, anger, greed, jealousy, thrill, happiness…All of them belongs to both. </p>
